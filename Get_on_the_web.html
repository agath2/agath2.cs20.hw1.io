    <div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start;">

            I like being under the table with a friend. We get to hang out :].
            <br />
            I can also think of other benefits of being under a table, such as being 
            able to closely observe other people's taste in shoes, or smiling at rats
            when they pass by. 
            <br />
            I am a under-the-table advocate.

    My favorite restaurant:
    <a href="https://www.photownusa7.com/" target="_blank">The great Pho Town 7!!</a>
    <br />
    I guess it is evident in their shop name, but
    They make very good Pho!
